# TA-Rating-and-Review-System
Spring back-end server and Android application to request, rate and review study or help sessions with Teaching Assistants (TAs) in a university.

Students, TAs or Professors can login using Google Plus. 

Students search for TAs by name or skills, sorted according to the ratings and initiate a study session with their choice of TA.

TAs can confirm their availability, decline or postpone requests.

Professors can view TAs of their courses and view their rating, declined and accepted requests.
